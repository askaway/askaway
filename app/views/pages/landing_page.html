        <h3>About Ask Away</h3>
        <p>
          Ask Away is a website where New Zealanders can ask the parties questions in the lead up to the elections, so that the parties are responding to the things people really care about. That means you can help to set the agenda this election, by asking and up-voting the questions that are important to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is also an easy way to find out about the parties and compare their views side by side.
