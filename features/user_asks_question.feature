Feature: User asks question
  As a user
  I want to ask the candidates a question
  So that I can find out if they care about the same things as me

  # Scenario: User asks question
  #   When I visit the home page
  #   And I click on "Ask a question"
  #   And I fill out the ask question form
  #   Then I should see the new question
    # Then I should be taken to the new questions list
    # And I should see my question at the top of the list
